 It's probably because launchctl is managing your mongod instance. If you want to start and shutdown mongod instance, unload that first:

 launchctl unload -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.mongodb.mongod.plist
 Then start mongod manually:

 mongod -f path/to/mongod.conf --fork
 You can find your mongod.conf location from ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.mongodb.mongod.plist.

 After that, db.shutdownServer() would work just fine.

 Added Feb 22 2014:

 If you have mongodb installed via homebrew, homebrew actually has a handy brew services command. To show current running services:

 brew services list

 To start mongodb:

 brew services start mongodb

 To stop mongodb if it's already running:

 brew services stop mongodb

 Update

 As edufinn pointed out in the comment, brew services is now available as user-defined command and can be installed with following command: brew tap gapple/services



Redis

To have launchd start redis now and restart at login:
  brew services start redis
  
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis.conf
